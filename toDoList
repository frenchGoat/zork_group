-CHECK DUNGEON ADD ROOM METHOD: made changes to add() method in dungeon class (add room) in which the method not only adds a room to the rooms hashtable but also to the teleDests hashtable - this was done to facilitate testing of the TeleportEvent class. its effects during hydration/restore and game play will need to be observed and possibly modified.
