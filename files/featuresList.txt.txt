Money - This is more of a passive feature which adds a some depth and the ability to allow for a trading system within the game. In the game there are Item subclass objects called coins which do not populate your inventory when taken but are deposited into a bank which score you some points and allow you to trade for things in play. Coins are randomly generated throughout the game in certain rooms. The only command which works on coins is take. You may review your bank by calling the inventory "i" command.
