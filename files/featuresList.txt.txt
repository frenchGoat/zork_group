Money - This is more of a passive feature which adds a some depth and the ability to allow for a trading system within the game. In the game there are Item subclass objects called coins which do not populate your inventory when taken but are deposited into a bank which score you some points and allow you to trade for things in play. Coins are randomly generated throughout the game in certain rooms. The only command which works on coins is take. You may review your bank by calling the inventory "i" command.

	<EXAMPLE>
	From loading screen:
		take Silver coin --- adds money into your bank

Talking with NPC - This was suppose to be a way to add depth to the story and allow the player to interact with the NPCs.

		talk to Giott --- this NPC was suppose to be the first person you meet and would get you started on your quest. Due to time issues he is now a test vendor.
		a --- opens a greeting/information speech bubble
		b --- opens a functional message that is suppose to activate or trigger an event, since there are only vendors in this game it opens the trade screen.
		c --- opens a good bye speech bubble.
